# DESCRIPTION :
The Time Tracking & Productivity Analytics Chrome Extension is a full-stack web application designed to help users monitor their online activity, track time spent on various websites, and analyze productivity trends. It runs in the background, automatically logging website usage and providing real-time insights through an interactive dashboard. Users can view detailed reports with charts and graphs, categorize websites as productive or distracting, and set custom alerts and time limits to manage their browsing habits effectively.

Built with React.js for the frontend and Node.js with Express.js for the backend, the extension leverages MongoDB (for cloud-based storage) or IndexedDB (for local storage). It integrates with Chrome APIs like Storage API, Tabs API, Alarms API, and Notifications API to enable seamless tracking, reminders, and notifications. Additional features include Focus Mode, which blocks distracting sites during work hours, and Data Sync & Export, allowing users to access their productivity reports across multiple devices.

Deployed via the Chrome Web Store, with backend hosting on Vercel or Netlify, this project provides hands-on experience with Chrome extension development, API integration, real-time data processing, and full-stack web development.
